                    Match Exchange stimulates a cash market at every point where a Lot is created, and doing so creates
                    a transparent and fair market for both buyers and sellers.

                        Match Exchange stimulates a cash market at every point where a Lot is created. By creating a
                        Match Exchange Lot you are communicating to the Market that you are a willing buyer or seller of
                        a specific portion of your product.

                        Once you have created a Lot, Match Exchange will match your Lot with counter Lots of similar
                        needs. Counter Lots display the 5 P’s and 2 Q’s of your own Lot in comparison to the counter
                        Lots, and you can enter into a negotiation with the matching Lot of your choosing.

                        consensus has been reached, you have a Match!
